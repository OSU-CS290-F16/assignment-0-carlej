    <p>This assignment was very difficult for me as I didn't have any experience with html before this. My largest problem was learning how to code in html but after doing a little random google and getting some help from my friend Nathan it was an easy assignment. Now I feel like I have the basics of how to add things into a web page and am excited to add some fun features into a web page other than a blank wall of text.</p>
